            <p>I am angry on the hero association, giving Bang such a cool name i.e. "Silverfang" and genos too "Demon cyborg"  why on earth would they
                    give me a name like caped baldy?! I mean okay it gives away my description and also the first thing that came to my mind but can't they 
                    have thought of something better I don't know something like "One Punch Man" man that would sound so much cooler than Caped Baldy it might 
                    even get a manga of the same name.Sigh... one can only wish.
